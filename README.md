This backend project is a simple file-based task manager built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. Instead of relying on a traditional database, the system stores each task as an individual text file inside the “files” directory. When a user submits a title and description through the form, the backend automatically creates a new .txt file using the title as the file name and the description as the file’s content. This approach makes the project very beginner-friendly, as it focuses on fundamental backend concepts without introducing database complexity.

The application reads all the files inside the “files” folder and displays their names on the homepage. Each task name is shown as a clickable link. When the user clicks “Read More,” the server reads the file content and renders it using an EJS template. This provides a clear demonstration of how server-side rendering works and how data flows from the backend to the frontend.

This project is a great introduction to backend development because it covers essential topics like routing, middleware, HTTP methods, and form handling in Express.js. It also teaches practical file handling using Node’s built-in fs module, such as creating files, reading directory contents, and loading file data dynamically. The UI is rendered using EJS templates, and Tailwind CSS is used to style the pages in a clean and responsive manner.

Overall, this backend project is ideal for beginners who want to understand how backend logic works, how servers process user input, and how data can be stored and retrieved using the filesystem. It provides a solid foundation for moving on to more advanced backend projects that include databases, authentication, and APIs.
